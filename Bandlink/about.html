    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>BandLink was created by college students who saw how hard it was for musicians to find collaborators on campus. Our mission is to make connecting through music as easy as sending a message.</p>
    <p>We believe in creativity, community, and opportunity â€” helping young artists grow their talent together.</p>
